Concretely, these powerful machine learning a lgorithms have\\ndemonstrated unprecedented capabilities in synthesizing realistic im ages, audio,\\ntext, and other data modalities [153]. In particular, these state- of-the-art lan-\\nguage and image generation models, leveraging the prowess of deep learning and\\ntransformer architectures, have enabled the generation of a va st array of ﬁelds.\\nGenerative AI refers to artiﬁcial intelligence that can generate no vel content,\\nrather than simply analyzing or acting on existing data like expert sys tems\\n[219]. Generative AI models, equipped with vast data sets and intrica te designs,\\nhave the extraordinary capability to create new and diverse conte nt. They can\\nprocess and learn from information gathered from a multitude of so urces, such\\nas Wikipedia [262], Github [94] and others. By tapping into this wealth of data,\\nthese models can generate an extensive range of multimedia format s, including\\nvideo, audio, and text.\\nDuring the recent years, the continuous growth in computing powe r has used\\ndeep neural networks [188], transformers and other innovative m odels like gen-\\nerative adversarial networks [113] and variational autoencode rs [219]. All these\\nmodels can eﬀectively capture the complexity of data, making them a dept at\\nmodeling high-dimensional probability distributions of language or imag es from\\nspeciﬁcorgeneraldomains.Bycomplementinggenerativemodelswit hadditional\\ntechniques that map the latent high-dimensional semantic space of language or'), Document(metadata={'source': 'A_survey_of_Generative_AI_Applications.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='2 Roberto Gozalo-Brizuela, Eduardo C.

This versatility allows for a seamless conversion between mu ltimedia\\nformats, making generative models invaluable in numerous application s. One of\\nthe most signiﬁcant aspects of generative AI is its potential for en dless applica-\\ntions. These models can be trained to generate genuinely diﬀerent m ultimedia\\nformats, like video, audio, or text, from various input formats. Fo r instance,\\ngenerative AI can be used to create realistic images from textual d escriptions,\\nproduce video content from audio, or even generate music compos itions based\\non speciﬁc styles or emotions. Furthermore, generative AI has th e potential to\\nrevolutionize industries such as advertising, entertainment, and e ducation by\\nautomating content creation and providing personalized experienc es. With the\\nability to learn from diverse data sources and generate a wide array of multi-\\nmedia outputs, these models can help businesses and individuals alike s ave time\\nand resources while tapping into new creative possibilities.In conclusio n, genera-\\ntive AI models, bolstered by their access to extensive data and com plex designs,\\noﬀer unparalleled potential in content creation and transformatio n. Their ability\\nto learn from various sources, generate diverse multimedia format s, and convert\\ninputs from one format to another opens up a vast array of applica tions in mul-\\ntimedia generation and conversion, making them indispensable tools in today’s\\ntechnology-driven world.\\nIn more recent work, there have been surveys of LLMs, and of Ge nerative AI,\\ntalkingaboutdiﬀerentapplicationsofthetechnology[328,85,323,326 ,324,68,325].\\nIn contrast to prior surveys, this comprehensive review aims to oﬀ er a unique\\nperspective by highlighting not only the most prominent generative m odels and\\ntheir underlying technologies but also by emphasizing on all the diﬀere nt uses of\\nthis technology. In addition, we give an up-to-date competitive out look in this\\ngrowing industry and the models behind this growth.\\nThis resource encompasses 15 categories, which include text, imag es, video,\\n3D,codeandsoftware,speech,AIunderstanding,business,ga ming,music,biotech,\\nbrain, others, and multimodal. Within each section, a thorough taxo nomy of the\\ncurrent technologies is presented, detailing both the models and to ols available.\\nBy oﬀering a systematic exploration of these diverse AI applications , the survey\\nserves as an essential reference for researchers, academics, and professionals, en-\\nabling them to comprehend better the evolving landscape of genera tive AI and\\nits far-reaching implications.\\nAs an example, a 3D game designer may have various generative AI ne eds\\nfor a project of his. He may ﬁnd a solution for his 3D AI needs under b oth 3D\\nand gaming, getting more speciﬁc results and diﬀerent answers.He may also ﬁnd\\nsolutions for more business needs of his under both business and te xt. With this\\nsurvey, we believe that users will get a very good outlook of how Gen erative AI\\nis shaping up and where they may ﬁnd their needed technology.\\nWe introduce, in this article, the proposition of an extensive dictiona ry cen-\\ntered on the most sought-after generative AI applications, which are notably\\nreshaping industries such as the videogames [199], design [183], and b usiness op-'), Document(metadata={'source': 'A_survey_of_Generative_AI_Applications.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='State of the Art of Generative AI 3\\nerations [2] sectors.

We achieve this by dividing Generative AI into 13 pa rts by\\nboth the output that is produced, the context in which they are be ing used\\nand the business use that this technology has. The reader may obs erve that\\nmany models could be placed in the text category as the output is tex t. Or that\\nmany copywriting models could also be placed under the text categor y. The\\nclassiﬁcation that is shown below serves for a prospective user of g enerative AI\\ntechnologies to quickly ﬁnd the technology they shall be using based on the use\\ncase. In this ﬁrst part, we introduce the categories in which we tax onomized\\ncurrent Generative AI technology. Here we present a summary of the diﬀerent\\ncategories: Regarding text, Generative AI technologies in the tex t category aim\\nto create and manipulate natural language text. These technolog ies include lan-\\nguagemodels that can generate human-liketext, such as OpenAI’s GPT models.\\nWhile the most famousof these models are chatbotssuch as OpenAI ’s ChatGPT\\nor Google’s BARD, other types of models are included in this category . These\\ninclude text-writing assistants, scientiﬁc language models or chatb ots. The main\\ncriterion for this category was that the models produce text as an output. Con-\\ncerning images, Generative AI technologies in the images category f ocus on the\\ncreation and manipulation of visual images. The main criteria in this cat egory\\nwas that the ﬁnal output was an image. This can include image creatin g models\\nthat can create images out of textual descriptions and image editin g models. For\\nsimplicity, the category was divided into artistic image creation, realis tic image\\ncreation and image editing. Some models that did two or more of these tasks\\nare arbitrarily included in one of the categories. Other models of this category\\ninclude text-to-layouts and text-to-molecular representations which could not\\nbe included in the aforementioned categories. Dealing with video, Gen erative AI\\ntechnologies in the video category aim to create and manipulate video content.\\nThe main criteria for this category was that the ﬁnal output was a v ideo. This\\nmainly includes video creation models that can generate new video con tent from\\ntextual descriptions. Other models include post production, text -to-scene gen-\\neration, text-to-motion capture, image-to-video as well as video dubbing. Also\\nworking with 3D, Generative AI technologies in the 3D category focu s on the\\ncreation and manipulation of three-dimensional objects and enviro nments. The\\nmain criteriawas usingthe output being a fully formed 3Dmodel. Alsoinc luded,\\nthere is a 4-D model and a 3-D model specially designed for metavers e purposes.\\nInputs include text, a single image,images and 2D models. Focusing on c ode\\nand software, Generative AI technologies in the code and softwar e category aim\\nto automate the process of writing code and creating software.

      "Summary: The Georgia Institute of Technology (commonly referred to as Georgia Tech and GT or, in the state of Georgia, as Tech or the Institute) is a public research university and institute of technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Established in 1885, it is part of the University System of Georgia and has satellite campuses in Savannah, Georgia; Metz, France; Shenzhen, China; and Singapore.\n",
      "The school was founded as the Georgia School of Technology as part of Reconstruction efforts to build an industrial economy in the Southern United States after the Civil War. Initially, it offered only a degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, its curriculum had expanded to include electrical, civil, and chemical engineering. In 1948, the school changed its name to reflect its evolution from a trade school to a technical institute and research university. Georgia Tech is organized into six colleges with about 31 departments and academic units. It has emphasizes the academic fields of science and technology.\n",

      "Page: Traditions of the Georgia Institute of Technology\n",
      "Summary: Numerous Georgia Tech legends and traditions have been established since the school's opening in 1888, some of which have persisted for decades. Over time, the school has grown from a trade school into a large research university, and the traditions reflect that heritage. One of the cherished holdovers from Tech's early years, a steam whistle blows every weekday at various times to mark the changing of classes. It's for this reason that the faculty newspaper is named The Whistle.\n",
      "Some of the traditions are well-known, the most notable being the now-banned tradition of stealing the \"T\" from Tech Tower. Tech Tower, Tech's historic primary administrative building, has the letters TECH hanging atop it on each of its four sides. A number of times, students have orchestrated complex plans to steal the huge symbolic letter T, and on occasion have carried this act out successfully. One especially well-known tradition that has existed nearly since the school's establishment is Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, Georgia Tech's heated, long-standing and ongoing rivalry with the University of Georgia. The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to 1891.\n",
      "Several legends originated at Georgia Tech. George P. Burdell, Tech's ever-present fictional student, was created in 1927 when a student filled out two application forms. Burdell went on to lead a long life; he earned several degrees, fought in World War II, and almost won Time's 2001 Person of the Year award. Georgia Tech is also known for the largest margin of victory in a football game, achieved in their 222-0 thrashing of Cumberland University in the 1916 Cumberland vs. Georgia Tech football game.\n",

      "Page: History of the Georgia Institute of Technology\n",
      "Summary: The history of the Georgia Institute of Technology can be traced back to Reconstruction-era plans to develop the industrial base of the Southern United States. Founded on October 13, 1885, in Atlanta as the Georgia School of Technology, the university opened in 1888 after the construction of Tech Tower and a shop building and only offered one degree in mechanical engineering. By 1901, degrees in electrical, civil, textile, and chemical engineering were also offered. In 1948, the name was changed to the Georgia Institute of Technology to reflect its evolution from an engineering school to a full technical institute and research university.\n",
